## Laboratory Sessions
The course includes several hands-on lab sessions where students will implement deep learning techniques using Python.
**Labs Overview:**

1. **Lab 1:** Deep Reinforcement Learning
2. **Lab 2:** Bayesian Deep Learning
3. **Lab 3:** Generative and Differentiable Forward Modeling

**Submission Guidelines:**
- Labs and projects are conducted in pairs.
- Each lab report must be submitted within the assigned deadline.

**Programming Requirements:**
- Python 3 and virtual environments (Conda, virtualenv)
- Cloud-based assignments using Google Colab
- Useful resources:
  - [Python Official Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/)
  - [Python+Numpy Tutorial](http://cs231n.github.io/python-numpy-tutorial/)

## Evaluation Criteria
The final grade for the course will be computed based on the following components:

- **S1 (30%)**: Written class grade (tests, questions, lab performance)
- **S2 (60%)**: Assignments (exercises and lab reports)
- **S3 (10%)**: Participation and discussion during labs and class

**Final Grade Formula:**
```
Final Grade = 0.3 * S1 + 0.6 * S2 + 0.1 * S3
```
